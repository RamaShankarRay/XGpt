 Create a full-stack, multi-user ChatGPT clone called **XGpt**, better than https://chat.openai.com in both design and functionality.

🧠 Architecture Requirements:
- Must support **multiple users** chatting simultaneously with their own data.
- Each user sees only their own chats.
- User-specific chat history stored securely.
- Firebase Authentication to manage unique user sessions.

---

🧱 Tech Stack:
- ⚛️ Frontend: React (latest), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- 🔥 Backend: Firebase (Authentication + Firestore for multi-user chat history)
- 🤖 AI Engine: OpenAI API (`gpt-4` or `gpt-3.5-turbo`)
- 🔐 Secrets: API key managed securely via `.env` or Replit secrets
- 📁 Modular folder structure

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Multi-User System:
- Firebase Authentication (Google sign-in preferred)
- Each user is identified by UID
- Firestore stores data like:
users/{uid}/chats/{chatId}/messages

yaml
Copy
Edit
- Users can:
- Create new chats
- View only their chat history
- Rename chats
- Delete chats

---




- Auto-title chat from first user message
- Chat history is passed in every request for context
- Stream-like response typing effect

---

🎨 UI/UX Must Include:
- Stunning minimal ChatGPT-like interface
- Responsive layout (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Sidebar with:
- New chat button
- List of previous chats
- User profile + sign-out
- Chat area:
- Markdown + syntax highlighting
- Typing animation
- Auto-scroll to latest
- Dark mode toggle
- Loading shimmer animation

---

🚦 Error Handling:
- Show clear error if OpenAI key is missing
- Show toasts for API or Firebase failures
- Retry on failed requests

---

🔐 Security:
- Firebase rules ensure:
- Users can only read/write their own data
- Do **not expose** OpenAI key in frontend beyond environment variable

🧪 Features to Implement:
- ✅ Sign in/out
- ✅ New chat
- ✅ View old chats
- ✅ Auto scroll + typing indicator
- ✅ Chat history stored per user
- ✅ Switch between multiple chats
- ✅ Loading + error UI
- ✅ OpenAI integration
- ✅ API key stored securely in Replit secrets
- ✅ Fully responsive and mobile-friendly

---

🏁 Stretch Goals (Optional but recommended):
- Voice-to-text
- Export chat as PDF
- Toggle GPT-3.5 and GPT-4
- Usage analytics
- Firebase Hosting ready

---

💡 Deployment:
- Should be deployable on:
- 🔥 Firebase Hosting

---

🎯 GOAL:
Build a beautiful, fully functional, scalable **multi-user ChatGPT clone** named **XGpt**, with Firebase for auth + storage, OpenAI for response, Tailwind for UI, and a clean modular codebase — as good as or better than ChatGPT.
